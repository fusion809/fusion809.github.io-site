    <p>Hi folks, I have not posted for a while, largely because whenever I try to write a post I end up thinking to make it correct I will need to make it very long and the post becomes so long it becomes practically impossible for me to remain motivated in writing it, as it will likely take me weeks. This post is just a nice and quick post to keep you’s up-to-date with what I have been doing, especially as it relates to Linux.</p>

<h2 id="quora-quests">Quora quests</h2>

<p>on of my favourite answers has not received any upvotes yet (93 views, however) and it was to, “What are the best free Linux games of all time?” <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-free-Linux-games-of-all-time/answer/Brenton-Horne">Here</a> is said answer.</p>

<h2 id="my-hopping-adventures">My hopping adventures</h2>
<p>I have been distro-hopping a little, due to bugs and mere curiosity. I had an issue wherein serveral systemd services (I think udev-related) failed on boot for newer kernels. For older kernels everything ran fine and for systemd-free distros everything booted fine. Re-installing these problem distros did not fix anything, I still received the exact same systemd failures. After I dd’ed my disk and re-installed my favourite distros these errors went away.</p>

<p>I also experimented with Btrfs and found it simply was not worth it. Its own tools do not report file system usage accurately; snapshots take up a lot of space and its only real advantage I liked (as snapshots were practically unusable for me) was that file system resizing was easier. LVM can be used as an alternative, with similarly easy file system resizing and if I ever really missed that feature I would probably now use LVM instead.</p>

<p>There is one distribution that has always been usable for me, never having any major issues (not affected by that odd systemd newer kernel issue) and it is Gentoo. It almost experienced a deal-breaking issue, that is its <a href="https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/net-wireless/broadcom-sta">net-wireless/broadcom-sta</a> package was going to be dropped making it impossible for my WiFi to work on my HP laptop with a Broadcom BCM4352 chip, but fortunately someone rescued this package. Debian had a major Broadcom wireless issue for a while where the broadcom-sta-dkms package would not build against newer kernels, so that meant Debian was disqualified from being “always usable” for me. I do not use Gentoo as my primary distribution anymore, however, as it takes forever to build up a full desktop environment so that I can try it out and when new releases of a desktop environment come out the builds can take even a matter of days, that is, if I use j values (in <code class="highlighter-rouge">make -j[Number]</code>) low enough to let my system still be reasonably responsive.</p>

<h2 id="my-present-distribution">My present distribution</h2>
<p>Presently I am writing this post from openSUSE Tumbleweed and using the i3 window manager. I like how I can get the openSUSE Build Service (OBS) to build packages even from the latest git commit of their respective repositories. For example, I have an <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:fusion809/openra-bleed">openra-bleed</a> package that builds OpenRA from the latest commit on the <a href="https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA">OpenRA repository’s</a> bleed branch for openSUSE Tumbleweed and openSUSE Leap (both 42.3 and 15.0). The beauty of OpenRA, however, is that it is very easy to manually compile it from source and run it from that. So far, I have not experienced an issue running OpenRA this way, on any distribution with git, Lua 5.1 and Mono in its repositories.</p>

<p>I do have nine other distributions installed on this PC, however, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Arch Linux, which I do boot from time-to-time.</li>
  <li>Debian 9</li>
  <li>deepin 15.6</li>
  <li>Fedora 28</li>
  <li>Gentoo Linux</li>
  <li>KDE Neon git unstable</li>
  <li>Linux Mint 19, upgraded from 18.3 to 19 as soon as it came out as a stable release (before the announcement, rather as soon as the ISO images came out). Although I should clarify, I used the recommended route of upgrade, a clean install.</li>
  <li>openSUSE Leap 15.0</li>
  <li>Ubuntu 18.04</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="accelrys-discovery-studio-visualizer-woes">Accelrys Discovery Studio Visualizer woes</h2>
<p>I also tried my best to get Accelrys Discovery Studio Visualizer (ADSV) running on my openSUSE Tumbleweed system. To do so I tried:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Installing it with its .bin installer, and satisfying its library dependency by adjusting PATH variables to use libraries in a directory I set up with libraries taken from CentOS 7 (which is the closest free operating system I could get to the ones the bin installer was designed for — Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 and SUSE Linux Enterprise 11). This failed.</li>
  <li>Installing it with its bin installer in a CentOS 7 Docker container and running it from there. That failed to, as it was difficult to get the DISPLAY variables right.</li>
  <li>Installing it via its bin installer on a Scientific Linux 7 (SL7) install on my PC, running <code class="highlighter-rouge">xhost +</code> and chrooting into it, running export DISPLAY=”:0” and running ADSV in it. This worked, but there was a graphical glitch wherein several atoms that were not meant to be black were partly coloured black. Running it on SL7 itself (without chrooting) did not fix this issue.</li>
  <li>Running it in a VirtualBox VM for Scientific Linux 7, this too did not fix this issue.</li>
  <li>Running it in a VirtualBox VM for Windows 10. This worked, the graphics were fine. It just is not a viable option as things are laggy as all …. in it.</li>
</ul>

<p>the reason I wanted to run this program is because I wanted to create 3D models of drug molecules and drug molecules binding to macromolecules (e.g. proteins and DNA) and ADSV produces the prettiest models, in my opinion (e.g. here is one of imatinib I made on Windows 10:</p>

<div class="image-box" style="width:; float: right;">

  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Imatinib_xtal-2007-balls-and-sticks.png" alt="" style="width:" />
  
</figure>
</div>

<p>I even uploaded it to Wikimedia Commons and it is on display at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib">imatinib Wikipedia article</a>).</p>

<h2 id="artwork">Artwork</h2>
<p>I did mention on The Hornery Facebook page, before I closed it down due to GDPR concerns, that I have been developing ‘artwork’ on <a href="https://github.com/fusion809/artwork">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://www.opendesktop.org/p/1236103/">openDesktop.org</a>. I use the term ‘artwork’ in single quotes because it really does not require much artistic talent to make it, I just create an image in an open-source piece of molecular modelling software based on data from real-world experiments, then in GIMP add labels and/or place it on a fractal background.</p>
